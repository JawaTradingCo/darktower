A simple, multi-leveled, rogue-text adventure that uses modular rooms, fixed inventory, and puzzle-solving to progress.

The idea is that the user is presented with a selection of randomly combined modules and provided with a finite set of tools with 
which to escape. By offering fixed-decision making I hope to make the gaming experience more efficient and fluid. This will hopefully prevent frustration in the myriads of failures the user is sure to face.

>The scent of brimstone is overpowering. Through a smokey haze you can make out a cage surrounded by candles in the center of the room. The cage containes an Imp. 
>A message is scribbled on a faded, yellow peice of paper attached with a thin, metal wire to the cage. The Imp looks at you with a toothy grin
>that fills you with suspicion.

You can:
- Read the note
- Look at the candles
- Open the cage
- Poke the Imp
